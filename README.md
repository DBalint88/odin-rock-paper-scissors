# odin-rock-paper-scissors
A simple rock-paper-scissors game for my Odin Project.

I think the assignment was meant to be run entirely on the console, but I quickly threw in some DOM manipulation so it can be played in the actual browser window.

One day I will come back to this and add some styling.  I'd like implement an unsplash API to show a random image of each of round of what has been played, e.g. a random image of "scissors" - although I've tested this and it loads quite slowly and isn't terribly accurate.  Maybe I'll curate some choice pictures.
